    <p>
      My name is Ivan Pashkulev aka Vankata and my ski courses will
      take you to another level of skiing and having fun:))
    </p>
    <p>
      You will delve into a friendly party atmosphere and intense ski training.
      There will be apreski dj parties with me being your DJ. Yeah that's right...
      and it's going to be awesome!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are looking for another relaxing holiday, well this is not for you!
    </p>
    <p>
      With this courses you will be pushed to your limits to become a really technical skier
      with knowledge and skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a great chance that you'll be turned into a party animal as a side effect:))
      Life is short so fasten your seat-belts and get ready to rock steady!
    </p>

    <p>
      During these courses you will have everyday meetings aiming to give you personal feedback and
      load your brain with some theory. Detailed video analyzes will be provided for each participant!
    </p>

    <p>
      And here is the most interesting part! What makes these courses stand out and be different and better?
      The most important part of a ski training are the current snow conditions.
      If you want to train your alpine skiing, you will need well groomed slopes!
      If you want to learn powder skiing, well you will definitely need some powder:))
      If you want to practise freestyle skiing, than a good snow park with a variety
      of equipments with different difficulty level would be appropriate.

    </p>
    <p>
      So if you book your holiday for a concrete resort a few months before, than how can you be sure that
      the conditions will meet your needs and expectations?

      The answer is - you can't!
    </p>

    <p>
      Have you been on a ski holiday with foggy and cloudy conditions, strong winds
      and the sun is gone for the entire week?
      Or maybe you wanted to free-ride but there is not enough snow.
      A really nice planned and long awaited holiday can easily turn into a disappointment
    </p>

    <p>
      So what's the solution?
      Don't compromise the ski holiday you've been waiting for and book a course without knowing
      the destination.Whaaat...???? It will be chosen based on current conditions
      and short term weather forecast just a few days before the course starting date. Sounds weird?
      Yes it is! It is adventurous, spontaneous but you know what... it gives you an extra thrill
      because of the unknown! Because let me remind you, your goal with these courses is not to
      visit a certain resort, but to become a better skier right?
      Your instructor will pick the perfect spot with the best
      possible conditions matching the requirements for the course objectives.
      Now you are already thinking.....oooh this is totally crazy, how can I book my low-cost flight,
      hotel reservations etc. Well you don't do that. You should book a last minute flight
      and I will take care about the rest. It will probably be more expensive mostly because
      of the last minute flight ticket but what you get as a result is unforgettable experience that
      will open entirely new horizons for you! You have my word!
    </p>

    <p>
      So finally, let's discuss what is the target audience for these courses?
      Well these courses are not for beginners. Why? Because literally any ski instructor
      can teach you how to snow plough and there is nothing special about that.
      Any resort would be OK for a beginners course and the snow conditions won't matter that much.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's say it, this courses are not for the average skiers.
      It's for those of you who can't wait for the winter to come.
      It's for passionate intermediate to advanced skiers
      who really want to go further. This means improved technical skills and increased knowledge.
      For those of you - Black slopes are nothing special, you feel confident at any slope.
      So there is an interesting question here. If you are looking for such a level of skiing
      why not go to a dedicated ski instructor course? If you want to become a ski instructor
      I encourage you to do that. Still you can benefit a lot from these courses because they
      will provide you with a solid foundation. On the other hand ski instructor courses
      involve much more theory and pedagogy. In our courses the main focus is on your personal
      technical training driving you to perfection and refinement.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what are you waiting for? Have a look at the available courses and pick the one
      matching your demands. The fun and excitement are guaranteed!
      Hope to see you soon around the mountains of our beautiful planet Earth!
